# Java LongPolling vs SSE vs WebSockets

1️⃣ **Long Polling**: Long polling is a technique where the client makes an HTTP request to the server, and the server keeps the connection open until new data is available

Once new data is available, the server responds to the request, and the client immediately sends another request to keep the connection open

**Example: Chat Application**

Imagine you're building a chat application. With long polling, a client could send a request to the server asking for any new messages

The server holds the request open until a new message arrives. Once a new message is received, the server responds with the new message, and the client immediately sends another request to keep the connection open for future messages

2️⃣ **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a technology that allows a server to push real-time updates to a client over a single, long-lived HTTP connection

**Example: Stock Market Updates**

Suppose you're developing a web application that displays real-time stock market updates to users

You can use SSE to establish a connection between the client and the server

The server can then push updates on stock prices, news, or other relevant information to the client as they occur without the client needing to continuously poll the server

3️⃣ **WebSockets**: WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, allowing for bidirectional communication between clients and servers

**Example: Real-Time Collaborative Editing**

Consider a real-time collaborative text editing application. With WebSockets, multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously

When one user makes a change, the change is sent to the server over the WebSocket connection, and the server broadcasts the change to all other connected clients in real time

This bidirectional communication allows for seamless collaboration without the need for constant polling
